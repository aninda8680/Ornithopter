# 🕊️ Ornithopter X

**Where Imagination Takes Flight**

Ornithopter X is not just a portfolio — it's a digital tribute to the futuristic dream of human-inspired flight. Inspired by da Vinci’s sketches and sci-fi visions, this interactive web experience brings the Ornithopter concept to life with motion, design, and storytelling.

## 🚀 The Product: Ornithopter

An **Ornithopter** is a flying machine that mimics the flapping wings of birds or insects. Unlike drones or planes, it relies on biomimicry — blending **engineering and nature** to achieve sustainable, agile flight.

In this concept:
- ✈️ **Energy-efficient flapping-wing mechanism**
- 🧠 Controlled by AI-assisted stabilization
- 🦾 Inspired by the anatomy of birds and dragonflies
- ♻️ Designed for low-noise, eco-conscious aviation

Imagine a world where personal flight is not noisy or artificial — but *natural*.
